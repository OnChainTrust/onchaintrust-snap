# OnChainTrust Snap

The snap displays information about an Owner of a Recipient Address / Smart Contract on the Transaction Confirmation Screen.

Additionally, it verifies safety of a transaction and provides protection against phishing and frontend attacks.

All use cases could be found on the [How it Works](https://app.onchaintrust.org/how-it-works) page.

## Testing

To test the snap, run `yarn test` in this directory. This will use
[`@metamask/snaps-jest`](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/tree/main/packages/snaps-jest)
to run the tests in `src/index.test.ts`.
